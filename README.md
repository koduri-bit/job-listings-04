![Design preview for the Job listings with filtering coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹


Thank You for checking out my project. I have done this frontend coding challenge to improve my skills in - HTML CSS Javascript and React ecosystem.

This challenge is taken from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt) a  website
to find front-end todo coding projects. Anyone with frontend skills can pull, design, develop and submit code. You can check more about this website by clicking this link - [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/).

The requirement of this application is -

- User can open and view application both Mobile (375px wide) and Desktop (1445px wide)

- User can filter jobs by selecting few tags `html` `css` and `javascript`

- Filtered tags should appear top of the page.

- User can clear one tag at a time and narrow job search OR user can clear all tags from filter using `Clear` button.


## To access this responsive application -

**Please click this link [Job-Listings](https://koduri-bit.github.io/job-listings-04/)**

## Project Highlights - 

**I did this challenge using HTML, CSS, Javascript and React hooks (ex: useState and useEffect).** 

**Application wide state is managed using Redux. And local state for component is managed using useState concept**

**See below projects where I would be using different state management concepts. Note the project still remains same `Job listings with filtering`, but the implementation changes as per below table**

  | Project                           |  Managing Application State | Managing Application side effects  |
  | :---                            |   :---:                       |   :---:                             |
  | [Job Listing-01](https://koduri-bit.github.io/job-listings-01/)    |   useState                    |   useEffect                            |
  | [Job Listing-02](https://koduri-bit.github.io/job-listings-02/)    | useState, useReducer          |   useEffect                            |
  | [Job Listing-03](https://koduri-bit.github.io/job-listings-03/)   (This project)                | useState, useReducer, useContext, React Context |  useEffect           |
  | [Job Listing-04](https://koduri-bit.github.io/job-listings-04/)                  | useState, Redux               |  useEffect                             |
  
**I have leveraged CSS modules concept, so I can have separate class names for styling html.**

**I have used normal CSS with Flexbox and Grid concept for styling.**

**I have used media queries for responsive design.**

**Desktop width targeted at 1440 and Mobile width targeted at 375.**

**No class based js files written for any react components. For class based type I will be doing another project and update in here with the link**
